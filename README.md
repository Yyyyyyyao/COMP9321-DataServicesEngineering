# COMP9321-DataServicesEngineering
### Course works on UNSW COMP9321

## **Assignment 1 - Data Analytics and visualization**
### Inroduction 
> The assignment is based on three datasets : exposure.csv, Countries.csv, Countries-Continents.csv these datasets are from Kaggle and we are not responsible for the political correctness of the data as this is just for the purpose of the exercise of working with data not to learm about geography.

> To run the code:
> python3 z5092195.py

> Output three Image files and set of dataframe to show the analytics

## **Assignment 2 - RESTful API**
>  Develop a Flask-Restx data service that allows a client to read and store some TV Shows, and allow the consumers to access the data through a REST API.

> To run the code:
> python3 z5092195.py

> Using Swagger to visualize the API Documents

## **Assignment 3 - Movie revenue and rating prediction using Machine learning models**
### Inroduction 
> Using the Movie dataset provided and the machine learning algorithm you have learned in this course in order to find out: knowing only things you could know before a film was released , what the rating and revenue of the film would be. the rationale here is that your client is a movie theater that would like to decide how long should they reserve the movie theater for to show a movie when it is released.

#### Part 1
Regression on Revenue without using Rating

#### Part 2
Classifier on Rating without using Revenue

##### **Key ideas**
* Data preprocessing
* Feature selection
* One hot encoding
* Model selection and tuning

> To run the code:
> python3 z5092195.py training.csv validation.csv

> Output 4 files
